# Nihilo Coin Swap for 15th March 2018


In order to do the coin swap, if you downloaded the **new wallet** on the first deadline of the swap **(last week)** you will need to update to the updated one.

### Do not skip this part if you already downloaded the new wallet on the first coin swap deadline last week

With that said, you will need to delete the new wallet you downloaded last week and also delete it's core folder. The core folder can be found in the following locations, based on your operating system.

### Windows
Go to the start menu and start typing **``%appdata%``** and click enter. This will open the **Windows Applications Data** folder. In here find a folder named **``Nihilo``** ( not **``NihiloCore``**, that is your old wallets core folder, do not touch that one ) and open the **``Nihilo``** folder and delete everything in there.

### MacOS
Open finder and in the top menu select **``Go``**, click **``Go To Folder...``**. In there type **``/Users/youruser/Library/Application Support/``** and replace **youruser** with your actual MacOS username and click **``Go``**. 

A new finder window will open, locate in there the **``Nihilo``** folder (**not ``NihiloCore``, that is your old wallets core folder, do not touch that one**) and open the **``Nihilo``** folder and delete everything in there.

### Linux
Go to your home directory and locate **``.nihilo``** folder (**not ``.nihilocore``, that is your old wallets core folder, do not touch that one**) and open the **``.nihilo``** folder and delete everything in there.

**Again do not touch the ``NihiloCore`` or ``.nihilocore`` folders**

# Download the new updated wallet
After you made sure that you deleted the new wallet that you downloaded last week, you now need to download the updated wallet.
